All classes must have their own .h and .cpp files
Transportation base class
	Number of passenger variable
	String variable that holds destination
	Integer that holds miles to destination
engine class
	integer that holds miles per hour
	Function that takes two Integers, total miles and miles per hour, and returns how many hours it will take to travel the total distance.
Derive a plane train and car from the base class transportation
	Each transportation derived class must contain an engine
	Function the prints out destination, and how many hours it will take to get to destination 
Derive a type of plane, train, car (e.g. Camaro from a car, Turboprop for a plane, high-speed for train)
	Set number of passengers, destination, miles to destination, and miles per hour in each constructor.
	Create a function that prints out to the screen:
		I have <number of passengers> passengers
		I am going to <destination>
		I go <miles per hour>
		It will take me <how many hours> to arrive
Create a test program that builds each type of plane train and car, calls the print to screen function for each one and pauses the program
